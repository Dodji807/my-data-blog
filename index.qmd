## Welcome to my Research Blog

This blog documents my final project of **EDLD 652 Course: Data Visualization Winter 2026**

I will be analysing how different tiers of support within the Muti-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) influence student improvement outcomes.

The research will specifically answer the following questions: 

Research Questions and Potential Visualizations

1. Do small-group lessons (Tiers 2 & 3) help more than whole-class teaching (Tier 1)?

2. Which Tier(s) is more effective for minority students compare to non-minority   
   students?

3. Does student behavior improve more when teachers receive specialized training?

Below you will find my RQ1 data analysis and visualization.
