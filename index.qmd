## Welcome to my Research Blog

Final Project: MTSS Data Analysis
Course: EDLD 652 | Data Visualization | Winter 2026

Project Overview

This project investigates how various levels of support within the Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework influence student growth. By analyzing intervention data, I aim to identify which strategies most effectively improve student from outcomes.

Research Questions

Instructional Impact: Do small-group lessons (Tiers 2 & 3) yield higher improvement than whole-class teaching (Tier 1)?

Equity in Outcomes: Which Tiers are most effective for minority students compared to non-minority students?

Professional Development: Does student behavior improve more when teachers receive specialized training?

Analysis: Research Question 1

Question: Do small-group lessons (Tiers 2 & 3) help more than whole-class teaching (Tier 1)?

The visualization below compares the Improvement Index across different delivery methods. This helps determine if targeted, smaller settings provide a significant advantage over universal instruction.
