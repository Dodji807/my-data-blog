## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of different educational interventions. Specifically, I am examining how various **delivery methods** impact the **Improvement Index** of students.

This analysis focuses on the **Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS)** framework, comparing two primary strategies:

-   **Small-Group (Tiers 2 & 3):** Targeted support for students who need more intensive help.

-   **Whole-Class (Tier 1):** Universal instruction provided to all students in a classroom.

By visualizing these differences, I aim to determine which delivery method consistently yields higher average student growth.

## Initial Project Visualization

#| label: fig-mtss
#| fig-cap: "Average Improvement Index by Delivery Method"
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)

# Ensure your CSV is in the 'data' folder of your project

df <- read_csv("Interventions_Studies_And_Findings_clean.csv")

# Calculate means 
mtss_data <- df %>% 
  summarise( 
    `Small-Group (Tiers 2 & 3)` = mean(f_Improvement_Index[s_Delivery_Method_Small_Group %in% 1], na.rm = TRUE), 
    `Whole-Class (Tier 1)` = mean(f_Improvement_Index[s_Delivery_Method_Whole_Class %in% 1], na.rm = TRUE) 
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Method", values_to = "Avg_Improvement")

# Create the visualization
ggplot(mtss_data, aes(x = reorder(Method, Avg_Improvement), y = Avg_Improvement, fill = Method)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Avg_Improvement, 2)), vjust = -0.5) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs( 
    title = "Average Improvement Index by Delivery Method", 
    x = "Delivery Method", 
    y = "Average Improvement Index" 
  ) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
